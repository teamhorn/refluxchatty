So, to answer numerous questions\/comments I've read in the past 1\/2 hour:<br \/><br \/>The fight was created by basically five people: Mike Watson (stunt choreographer), Dan Minahan (Director), David Milch, Alan Graf, and me.<br \/><br \/>Ken Clark was my stunt double, Derrick Graf was Alan's. They were used in the long shots where Hearst\/Al were watching from their balconies. In tight shots, they did the roll through the tables where the glass was breaking and they did the back flip over the meat table. Otherwise, it was Alan and I rolling through the muck.<br \/><br \/>Milch had three parameters for the fight: 1) must be realistic -- \"No Cowboy roundhouses, flying through fucking plate glass\" 2) the audience must never be allowed to draw their breath, just when they think it is going to ease up, it escalates in intensity. 3) \"I want something I've never seen before\"<br \/><br \/>We rehearsed for three days and created the fight. We'd toss in suggestions, try things out. I can't remember who exactly suggested what, other than what I contributed. My suggestions yeilded the facial bite, the mud-drowning and subsequent puking, and the eyeball was a combination of three factors.<br \/><br \/>The idea was to be as primal as possible. Orginally that had me bashing his head with a oxen yolk. I wanted a stick instead.<br \/><br \/>I'd written a story arc (not used) that had Dority hitting someone in the forehead so hard that their eyeball popped out (my Grandfather did this to someone once -- it can really happen). We have an advisor on the show who once worked for a Vegas casino interest as an enforcer. His specialty was (if you owed big money and didn't pay) was to gouge an eyeball out with his thumb. David wanted to use the eyeball bit. As we were in the midst of creating the fight, I stumbled across a story. I am a part of a weekly poker game at Jerry Cantrell's (the rock guitarist) house. We were talking about the eyeball bit when Jerry told me the story of his brother in a fight in a biker bar. His bro was getting his head slammed into the pool table. He was getting tunnel vision as his lights were going out. Merely by chance, as he tried to push his opponent off of him, one of his fingers stuck into the eye of his opponent. Sensing he was about to die, his bro just shoved that finger with all his might. End of fight.<br \/><br \/>The next day we had fight rehearsal. I told David, \"I have an idea about that eyeball...\"<br \/><br \/>So, yes, Dority was dying. He was but a few breaths away from losing permanently. By chance, he got a finger into the Captain's eye. Not one to simply let the gouge be a final move, Dan plucked out the eye. After all, \"if an eye offends thee, pluck it out...\"<br \/><br \/>Dan's post-fight response was a combination of many things folks have speculated about on here. Dan almost died -- a new experience. He'd met an opponent who was stronger than him -- that had never happened before. He killed a man eye to eye with whom he had respect for as a warrior. He'd given everything he had to give, physically, spiritually, and emotionally. So as I sat there naked, refusing attention, all those things were going through my mind.<br \/><br \/>Speaking of nekkid -- that was my idea. The first version David had prepared had me in my muddied clothes. I thought by sitting there completely stripped in every way imaginable, the image could say more than the words. David agreed.<br \/><br \/>A day or so after we shot, Mark Tinker said he'd seen the dailies and he was going on and on about how emotionally involving the scene was. To show you how commited to authenticity I am, my response, \"Yeah, that's cool and all, but did my dick look big?\"<br \/><br \/>Someone questioned the reason for greasing up my groin for the fight. If you've ever had someone grab your nutsack in a tussle then yank on it, you'll know why I greased the boys up.<br \/><br \/>So... that's the fight. Glad yall liked it. I sure as hell did. I think we pulled off everything the Maestro asked for and more.<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>Earl<\/span>","lols":[{"tag":"inf","count":1}]},{"id":33161165,"threadId":33161165,"parentId":0,"author":"Nixx2004","category":"ontopic","date":"2015-02-26T02:18:00Z","body":"I finished watching <i>Deadwood<\/i> last night.

It doesn't feel like it plays better than Civ V does with all the expansions now.<br \/><br \/>- The tech web just feels messy to navigate. The icons are too similar, you don't really understand what each technology essentially does until you read all of the text, and finding anything requires a lot of mousing around because it's not obvious how one fictional technology relates to any of the pre-requisite technologies near it. The most efficient way to use the tech tree is to just find the icon for whatever affinity you're building towards. It would be a good idea if it were better implemented, but I think some mods fixed this even within the first week of the game's release.<br \/><br \/>- The victory conditions are all different flavors of the same thing. Other than domination, which I believe now just works exactly like Civ V, every other victory condition is basically just mass one affinity in the tech web, then build a wonder, then wait for a progress bar to fill while you hit next turn. Whereas with policies, it felt like the direction you worked toward drastically changed the flavor of your civilization, all the victory decisions in Civ V are just resource management with palate swaps.<br \/><br \/>- The diplomacy system is a huge step back. You lose the end-game strategizing from the UN, and they replaced it with \"favors\", a terribly thought-out system. Favors are just currency with a hidden value. You give someone a favor in exchange for a usable good. For the AI, they're programmed to value a favor the same way as any other resource, but you don't know what the value is until you try to trade it in. For a player, there's no value in ever letting someone cash in a favor. You could just trade a hundred favors and when someone tries to use them, you can refuse and they can't do anything about it. The AI also never declared war on me, no matter what I did.","lols":[]},{"id":33161076,"threadId":33161056,"parentId":33161056,"author":"MagicWishMonkey","category":"ontopic","date":"2015-02-26T01:50:00Z","body":"It kind of sucks.

Its catalog is just as diverse as Spotify's, and I vastly prefer their apps and \"radio\" functions to any of the other services.<br \/><br \/>Beats has some pretty strong curation\/playlists that are neat, but when I last tried them they were lacking in catalog.

All of your music, in the cloud, combined with all-you-can-eat streaming of Beats catalog, at a lower price than the majors. This will be my end-all-be-all. My own music to cover in the gaps in subscription catalogs (Thom Yorke, Underworld live sets, Tool, etc.) but just as convenient to stream to all my devices.
