The consistency of a peanut butter cookie is not right for holding the chips. It will work if you add chips to a peanut butter cookie, don't get me wrong, but it's not going to be as pleasant as a chocolate chip cookie dough. Chocolate chip cookies are drop cookies and peanut butter cookies are rolled cookies. They are just different. Mass producing a peanut butter cookie with  peanut butter chips would be too complicated and probably require specialty equipment.  <br \/><br \/>I think if you make a basic chocolate chip cookie recipe and add some peanut butter powder and chips to it, you might get what you are after!

Especially since you're coming from traditional stuff. You can literally paint beside the Bob Ross Master tutorial DVD set and emulate everything he does with oils. All the brushes simulate realistic oil (there is viscosity, lumping, blending, bleeding) all into the brush itself. You can bring out canvas depth and make the paint react accordingly to the type of canvas, so you would actually see relief from a highly textured canvas coming through.<br \/><br \/>PS can do all this too but in PS you have to work around that kinda stuff, go from A to B to C to D. Painter is basically a paint brush simulator and does this all A to B, real naturally.<br \/><br \/>On top of oils there is everything else from pastel, chalk, acrylic, gauche, impasto etc.<br \/><br \/>","lols":[]},{"id":33110420,"threadId":33109916,"parentId":33109916,"author":"jane911","category":"ontopic","date":"2015-02-13T03:12:00Z","body":"I love this so much, I Michael Bay'd it!

What did my wife and kids work on while I was out of town on business? Nothing. They were just going to do a sack?! What the fuck? So I spent an hour on Pinterest and found a monster box for my daughter and a Luigi box for my son. They probably won't win awards but they at least look good. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http:\/\/chattypics.com\/files\/iPhoneUpload_1fgekp6eni.jpg\">http:\/\/chattypics.com\/files\/iPhoneUpload_1fgekp6eni.jpg<\/a> - dots go on tomorrow. Luigi is being pressed down for the glue to stick. <br \/><br \/>(My mom and I made an OG game boy box when I was a kid that was pretty badass. I can't say for sure that it won but in my memory -- it won.)<br \/><br \/>Then my kids asked if we had candy to go with. Of course I said! We purchased some Cars and Brave ones last year that had candy dip inserts that we knew would keep. Nope -- my wife didn't get those out (she lost them). So I looked at what the kids had ... Animaniacs?! They make Animaniacs Valentine's Day cards in 2015?! <br \/><br \/><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http:\/\/chattypics.com\/files\/iPhoneUpload_68y5q4ghbu.jpg\">http:\/\/chattypics.com\/files\/iPhoneUpload_68y5q4ghbu.jpg<\/a> - 1994. She broke out Valentines she found at her fucking parents' house that are 21 years old. They are just kids she said! They don't care she said. Well I do care! I want to show my kids I at least give last year's clearance shit care. Some parent is going to look at the stash and go \"Wtf Animaniacs?! That's cool ... Wait a second!\" Just like I did. There will be my son's name. I'll get an email from some mom asking if we need help with the new house and they are concerned that we can't afford Valentine's Day cards. The school is going to ask if we need hot lunch assistance. My kids will forever be known as the kids who brought 21 year old Valentine's Day cards to school.<br \/><br \/>Now this is where you tell me I'm crazy and that I shouldn't even thank Obama here.

Lift your shoulders up as high as you can as if you were touching your earlobes to your shoulders. As soon as they're as high as they can go comfortably, use gravity to drop your shoulders back down really loosely, so that even your arms sort of wiggle loosely around when they drop down. Do this 9x or until you feel warm and relaxed. Don't hold the shoulders at the top of them reaching up at all, just immediately drop them down loosely - and don't hold your breath either. Just breathe gently.<br \/><br \/>2) After the shoulders, while still standing, take all 5 fingertips of both hands and use them to rake across your scalp from the hairline back and all the way down to the base of the skull. Use only the fingertips, with your fingers and hands sort of curved and not touching the head. Do this 100x. Breathe really gently the whole time, because your shoulders and arms will get more tired if you are holding your breath. <br \/><br \/>I guarantee you will feel very loosened up and relaxed after these two. If you want, after you do your shoulder shrugs, but before the scalp massage, you can rub up and down over the whole fronts of the ears with the flats of your palms until your ears are very hot and tingling, for extra results.","lols":[{"tag":"tag","count":1}]},{"id":33111057,"threadId":33110819,"parentId":33110819,"author":"pgharavi","category":"ontopic","date":"2015-02-13T06:45:00Z","body":"carpet + lacrosse ball + roll on floor.","lols":[]},{"id":33111039,"threadId":33110819,"parentId":33110989,"author":"Dannychico","category":"ontopic","date":"2015-02-13T06:37:00Z","body":"That's ibuprofen, no?","lols":[]},{"id":33110989,"threadId":33110819,"parentId":33110975,"author":"danws6","category":"ontopic","date":"2015-02-13T06:19:00Z","body":"The only pain pills I have is excedrin for migraines.
