As you all know, the announcement of a desktop version of République saved our Kickstarter. You may also recall that I really dragged my feet on announcing the game for PC, not because we don't like PC gaming (we love it), but because I wasn’t confident that we could translate the core RÉ experience into a mouse+keyboard experience that you would think it worthy of the marketplace’s attention. That’s why, back in 2012, we committed to investing a significant amount of time and effort into making the desktop edition of République play to the strengths of the platform. Now that we’ve been playing the game on PC for the better part of a year (constantly tweaking the controls and UI along the way), we are 100% confident that République now plays best on PC and Mac. We’re still satisfied with our touch gameplay on mobile, but the desktop version makes the whole experience feel more thoughtful and fluid. My hat goes off to all the guys on the team for their hard work and relentless commitment to making this version awesome.<br /><br />In the spirit of transparency, we actually had a really good PC & Mac version of République ready last summer (a lot of you alpha/beta tested it out too, and rated it very favorably), but I put the brakes on releasing it because I felt that it lacked something special and exciting, and I couldn’t put my finger on it…<br /><br />One area of concern I’ve had since our Kickstarter campaign was how our mobile-friendly Unity 4 graphics would translate to PC. To my surprise, private backer betas yielded extremely positive comments about the graphics, even though I knew we were not going to be competitive on Steam. If anything, I felt that the surveys were saying, “Yeah! This looks good for a mobile game on Steam!” And that’s the sort of thing that haunted me – République on desktop needed to stand on its own two legs, no mobile caveats.<br /><br />Then last summer, a friend of mine suggested that we fully embrace the next generation of Unity’s engine, which is all about bringing modern graphics features to AAA and independent developers alike. Despite not knowing how much work it would be to completely embrace Unity 5, I fell in love with the idea and approached the team with this proposition: instead of releasing our near-finished desktop build, we would fully embrace Unity 5 and fight tooth and nail to be a hallmark title for this new technology. After some hesitation and internal tests, the team got behind the idea. While we were disappointed that it would push back our release date (we thought we’d release December 2014, at the latest), we all agreed that this is the special sauce that we originally lacked in the desktop version. Little did we know that in order to completely embrace Unity 5’s high end, it would require us to totally remaster the game’s art content, but as you’ll see on February 26, it’s been worth the effort.</i>","lols":[]},"parentAuthor":"LoioshDwaggie"}}]}
