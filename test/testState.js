Consitantly for the past 20 years, they will be presented with two or more takes on a property, and almost always go with the worst version. A number of the Batman films in development were was better than Batman Begins. Now they did end up giving us The Dark Knight which was good but I'm sure they did their best to hurt that movie behind the scenes. I'm being somewhat sarcastic. I know they didn't intend on hurting any film but they seem to find away.<br /><br />Recently, Batman V Superman Dawn of Justice and Suicide squad. Way back in November and December, both films underwent focus testing. Suicide Squad did way better than Dawn of Justice. The hype for Suicide Squad was higher. They even started showing Batman in the Suicide Squad promos (which originally was suppose to be a secret till release) just to get people more excited for Dawn of Justice. They knew going into March that Dawn of Justice wasn't a great movie and movie goes weren't that excited. It did well but not great. in panic mode, WB ordered reshoots for Suicide Squad. Even though they knew, Suicide Squad was a better and different movie than Dawn of Justice, they edited the movie and added scenes in response to Dawn of Justice criticisms. <br /><br />Hopefully with the management shakeup, future DC movies will be handled better, but I doubt it.","date":"2016-08-04T13:50:00.000Z","replyCount":28,"children":[{"id":35274464,"author":"ShXIII","body":"I don't get it.

The ones I hate most are when the candidate shows no personality what so ever and tries way too hard to look and act the part their mental image of the position holds. I mean yes, they need to meet the qualifications and be competent in their abilities. But I'd rather the person just be themselves rather than put on a mask. If you are hired I'm going to get to know the real you sooner or later anyway, and you pretending to be anything else just gives me an impression you're hiding something.

Yeah, I've had interviews like that. Mostly I am drawn to really smart shy engineers, I feel a little kinship with them. Doing well on intellectual tests and then having a humble attitude is such a winning combo for me.<br /><br />On the other end of the spectrum had so many horrible interviews with mid level business guys. When you go looking for someone to run a team of 30 or help with strategy, you get a lot of people who keep failing upwards cause they look good in a suit. Typical profile of the groanworthy candidate is like tall white man from an ivy, changed jobs every 12-18 months through his whole career, no discernible individual contribution. Often times the resume has one big 'right place at the right time' role about 5-6 years ago like Google or something similar where they happened to be along for the ride as the company did well and then when they tried to translate that company success into individual career success at the next job they failed a bunch of times and ended up at my doorstop. Those interviews are really frustrating..they keep waving hands and being confident about their previous roles but then when you ask them about challenges and outcomes they always have some weird excuse about how the market wasn't right for their idea or the company decided it wasn't a strategic fit just as a coincidence after they had been there for 12 months. You kinda have to look at the forest through the trees and go nobody has this many failures in a row and is that smooth at explaining them away. But I always feel like somewhere else someone is hiring that dude and he's off to the next 300-500k/yr job until they figure him out.<br />","date":"2016-08-04T13:00:00.000Z","replyCount":0,"children":[],"parentId":35273842,"category":"ontopic","dateStr":"09:00 AM"},{"id":35274374,"author":"ArcKnight","body":"The guy who thought code reviews were insulting and a waste of time stands out - but only when talking about his own code is one.<br /><br />I didn't do this interview, but a friend on another team did: the guy who insisted on wearing a lab coat to his interview (he asked ahead of time) because he was a 'design mad scientist'.

The nail polish isnt actually nail polish, not in the dreamscape of human thought anyway.  Its so much more than that but you are a human with a meat brain, and it has to extrapolate what has happened into something you can understand.  Hence why you see it as nail polish on your shack shirt.  But you and I, and everyone who hears the story or sees the shirt will know the truth even if we dont consciously grasp it.  Whats important is that subconsciously (and im using that term just as a means for us to have some sort of understandable term for what has happened even though its so much more than that) you and everyone else really does understand.  Its part of what makes us who and what we are, its essential for the shared human experience and I just don't want you to feel any sort of negativity towards it, ok? Just lett it happen, even though to you its actually already happened.  Just understand that when you get the chance to change it, when that subtle mating of thought and dream and reality comes back around, dont try to stop it from happening.

It took about 1 month as the build to order. Even though it's a US company the desk is made in China and shipped from there in two separate parts, one the legs and control box and the second is the table top.<br /><br />You can also save yourself some cash and only order the motorized legs and make your own table top, it's easy to screw on. <br /><br />If you have any other questions about the desk shoot me a pm and happy to answer or take more photos etc. ","date":"2016-08-04T12:10:00.000Z","replyCount":0,"children":[],"parentId":35274102,"category":"ontopic","dateStr":"08:10 AM"},{"id":35274226,"author":"reddwarf_","body":"And thanks man, I'm so happy I pulled it all off after planning for ages.

It's a really nice desk. The top seems fine. Nothing special. I'd have preferred a wood grain, but had to get the black powder coat for the cut option. Still, it looks nice and matches all the accessories, so whatever. <br /><br />It glides up and down very smoothly, and even though I'll most likely use it sitting down 95% of the time, I'm really glad to have a desk where the height is customizable to exactly how high is comfortable for me. With a keyboard tray and ergonomic chair, it's by far the most comfortable desk I've ever used.<br /><br />The main complaint I have so far is that they really don't give you any clue when you're ordering it about how the accessories work together. I bought way too many accessories and found that I really didn't have room for all of them, or some of them didn't exactly go together very well. For example, the CPU holder is actually too narrow for my case, which is a mini-ITX case, but just happens to be wider than usual. Probably my fault on that, so that's okay. But after mounting the rotating drawer, keyboard tray and motorized parts, there really isn't much room on the underside of the desk to put it anyway. <br /><br />Also, I decided to take off the extra support beams so I could mount a longer keyboard tray rail, because with the short one, it only slides back to a position that keeps me very far from the edge of the desk, and makes getting close with the curve really pointless. But when I mounted it, I found that it partially obscured the center grommet where my monitor wires are running. It wasn't so bad that I couldn't still use both the grommet and keyboard mount, but I had to get creative with how I secured the backstop for the keyboard tray.<br /><br />Basically, it feels like while the stock items are really well thought out and they give you plenty of guide holes and good instructions, the accessories feel like they require a little more manual work than some people might want in assembling a desk.<br /><br />","date":"2016-08-04T06:16:00.000Z","replyCount":0,"children":[{"id":35274285,"author":"kn1fe","body":"That's cool that you like it, I don't think I will be using the keyboard tray so hopefully I won't have issues.
